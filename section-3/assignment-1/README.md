# Node.js&mdash;The Complete Guide  

## Section III, Assignment 1:

### Time to Practice&mdash;The Basics

The purpose of this assignment is to review the concepts covered in **_Section III:
Understanding the Basics_**. The requirements for the assignment, as outlined by
Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller, are as follows:

***

## Requirements

1. Spin up a Node.js-driven Server (on port 3000).

1. Handle two Routes: "/" and "/users".

  - Return some greeting text on "/".
  - Return a list of dummy users (e.g. \<ul>\<li>User 1\</li>\</ul>)
  
3. Add a form with a "username" input to the "/" page and submit a POST request
to "/create-user" upon a button click.

1. Add the "/create-user" route and parse the incoming data (i.e. the username
and simply log it to the console.

## My Solution

I intend to emulate the modularized approach demonstrated in **Lecture 37: Using
the Node Module System** to realize my solution to the above assignment requirements.
