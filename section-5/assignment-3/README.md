# Node.js&mdash;The Complete Guide

## Instructor: Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller

### Assignment 3: Time to Practice Navigation

This self-directed assignment has the following requirements:

1. Create an npm project and install Express.js (nodemon if you want).

1. Create an Express.js app which serves two HTML files (of your choice/your
content), served, for example to routes of '/' and '/users'.

1. Add some static (.js or .css) files to your project that should be required
by at least one of your HTML files.

#### MY SOLUTION:

Using broad interpretation of the requirements for the assignment, I am creating
a small app that will serve some dummy data for physical fitness data to the screen,
with one screen showing existing data, and another allowing the user to add fitness
data to that already displayed on the screen.

For the moment, however, because we have no data persistence, the new data will be
logged to the console.
