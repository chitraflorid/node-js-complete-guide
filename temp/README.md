### Assignment 4: Time to Practice&mdash;Templating Engines

The objective of this assignment is to create a Node.js/Express application that
displays a page of users, and also has a page devoted to adding users to that
list.

The application should make use of one of the three templating engines covered
in Section 6:

- Pug
- Handlebars
- EJS (Embedded Java Script)

The requirements for this assignment are stated as follows by Maximillian
Schwarzmüller:

1. Create an npm project and install Express.js (nodemon if you want).

1. Add two routes:

- "/" => Holds a \<form\> that allows users to input their name.
- "/users" => outputs on \<ul\> with the users names (or some error text).

### My Solution:

I intend to use the EJS templating engine as it seems the best balance of function
and form to me among the three templating engines covered in Section 6.

To go beyond the bare minimum, I also intend to apply at least some nominal styling.

And, of course, as mentioned in the instructional video for this assignment, I intend
to create EJS partials to be included in the EJS templates for the application.
